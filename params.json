{"name":"Course Advice System","tagline":"","body":"## Welcome to my [OOTI](http://wwwooti.win.tue.nl/) Mini-project: Course Advices System.\r\n\r\n### System Overview\r\nThe main idea of this mini project is to provide a platform for students who have completed courses to give advice to students who are currently enrolled or about to enroll in the same course. The main use case is driven by a student as a main actor, who can give an advice for already completed courses. The advice can be a tip, additional learning sources, multimedia, feedback, etc. Other student can evaluate the advice for particular course (helpful or not) and can contribute in the process of creating helpful advices. By using the feedback other student will know how helpful a given advice is. The student can set following courses, completed courses, favorite courses and favorite advices. The system has to have central data repository that can be accessed by different clients.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nIf you have any questions or comments please do not hesitate to ask me: m.janeski[at]tue.nl","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
