{"name":"Course Advice System","tagline":"","body":"## Welcome to my [OOTI](http://wwwooti.win.tue.nl/) Mini-project: Course Advices System.\r\n\r\n### System Overview\r\nThe main idea of this mini project is to provide a platform for students who have completed courses to give advice to students who are currently enrolled or about to enroll in the same course. The main use case is driven by a student as a main actor, who can give an advice for already completed courses. The advice can be a tip, additional learning sources, multimedia, feedback, etc. Other student can evaluate the advice for particular course (helpful or not) and can contribute in the process of creating helpful advices. By using the feedback other student will know how helpful a given advice is. The student can set following courses, completed courses, favorite courses and favorite advices. The system has to have central data repository that can be accessed by different clients.\r\n\r\n###Functional Requirements\r\n\r\n\r\n###Nonfunctional Requirements\r\nFew non-functional requirements were derived from the original project idea. They are described in the following section.\r\n####Scalability\r\nScalability is the ability of a system to function well (without degradation of other quality attributes) when the system is changed in size or in volume in order to meet usersâ€™ needs. One of the major issues in scalability is the capacity of the system to accommodate an increasing number of users without a degradation of the systems performance as already described. This non-functional requirement is directly connected with the provided solution. The Course Advice System is meant to be used on every university regardless the number of the enrolled students or the number of lecturers or courses.\r\n####Extensibility\r\nExtensibility is the ease with which the system capabilities can be extended without affecting other services or parts of the system. Extensibility for architecture today is important because the business environment in which a software system lives is continually changing and evolving. These changes in the environment will mean changes in the software system, service users, and services providers and the messages exchanged among them. The ability to extend and to cover different study groups, educational institutions, and different courses is the main reason why this quality attribute is important for the Course Advice System.\r\n####Adaptability\r\nAdaptability means the ease with which a system may be changed to fit changed requirements. Adaptability for the Course Advice System means that it can adapt quickly to new opportunities and potential competitive threats. Knowing the fact that the education system is changing end evolving, the Course Advice System should follow this in order to response to the customer needs.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nIf you have any questions or comments please do not hesitate to ask me: m.janeski[at]tue.nl","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
